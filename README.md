This program computes the Present Value and the Delta based off user inputs.
There is error handling to prompt the user if a character is entered instead of a number.
For Delta computation, error handling is in place for when the Change in rate is 0.
This prevents unexpected program exits.

The following formulas were used:
Below PV= Present Value, FV= Future Value, r= rate, n= number of periods

PV = FV / (1+r)^n

Delta = Change in PV/Change in r
